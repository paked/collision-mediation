        <h1>Collision Detection: A Story of Mediation</h1>

        <p>If you're anything like me, when you look at something like collision detection your brain immediately turns off. Why is that? "It's too fucking scary" you say? Yeah. I get that. It sucks right! You want to build that awesome game, but can't seem to get past step 3.</p>

        <p>Here's the deal though: It doesn't have to be. As great as the internet is, one thing it has NOT done very well is make collision detection seem like an approachable topic. But once you have something even slightly resembling an collision detection system, you realise you have to figure out how to resolve those collisions. If the internet was bad at helping your learn about collision detection... Well, let's turn around now: Game over.</p>

        <p>So. This is an explanation (potentially it's explorable too?) for humans, how to detect (AND RESOLVE) collisions in your game or experiment or whatever. <b>Let's get started!</b></p>

        <h2>Introductions</h2>

        <p>Reader, I'd like to introduce you to two of our volunteers for today:</p>

        <p>This is <span class="steven-fg">Steven</span>:</p>

        <div class="character steven"></div>

        <p>And this is <span class="reina-fg">Reina</span>:</p>

        <div class="character reina"></div>

        <p><span class="steven-fg">Steven</span> and <span class="reina-fg">Reina</span> are good friends, and they've been that way for years. Like most purely platonic two dimensional shapes, they have one hesitation: Overlapping.</p>

        <p>Previously, they've just manually prevented themselves from overlapping... But after a particularly bad incident from last week at the sanddwich shop (which they both agreed was both of their faults), they want to put a proper system in place to handle future incidents.</p>

        <p>As you can probably tell, both Steven and Reina are 2D boxes (Rest assured, they're not about to go all FEZ on you).</p>

        <h2>Use the space, reader!</h2>

        <p>The first thing we need to do is be able to represent <span class="steven-fg">Steven</span> and <span class="reina-fg">Reina</span> in virtual space:</p>
